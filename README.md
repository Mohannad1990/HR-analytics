I recently completed an insightful Power BI project from DataCamp, focusing on employee demographics, performance, and attrition analytics for Atlas Labs. Here's a snapshot of the key insights:

üîç Key Insights from the report:
-Employee Demographics and Diversity:
The report provides a comprehensive view of the workforce's diversity, including age, gender, marital status, and ethnicity. It highlights a diverse age range from 18 to 51 years and showcases a balanced distribution across different ethnicities.
Performance Tracking:
-Detailed performance metrics for individual employees, including job satisfaction, relationship satisfaction, work-life balance, and manager ratings. This feature allows for personalized performance management and identifies areas for employee development.
-Attrition Analysis:
The report highlights an attrition rate of 16.1%, with deeper insights into how factors such as department, job role, hire date, travel frequency, overtime requirements, and tenure influence attrition rates. For instance, higher attrition is observed among frequent travelers and employees in specific job roles.
-Hiring Trends and Active Employees:
Visualizations on hiring trends over the years and the distribution of active employees by department provide insights into the company's growth and workforce stability.
-Salary and Ethnicity Insights:
Analysis of employee salary distribution across different ethnic groups helps understand compensation equity and identify areas for improvement.
